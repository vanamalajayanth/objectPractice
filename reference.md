Rahul,
 a software engineer 
 from Pune,
  enjoys playing chess and gardening when he's not busy coding.
   He owns a golden retriever named Max, 
   who is 4 years old,
    fully vaccinated,
     and loves playing fetch in the park.
      Rahul is currently employed 
      and has a car that he uses for weekend trips.
 Meanwhile, Ananya, 
       who recently turned 30
        and lives in Bangalore,
         is passionate about cooking and often experiments with Italian recipes.
          She has a parrot
           named Kiwi,
            who knows over 20 phrases, mimics her voice,
             and is also vaccinated.

              Both Rahul and Ananya studied computer science in college,
               though Ananya also has a minor in graphic design.
